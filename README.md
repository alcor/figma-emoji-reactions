This plugin creates reactions on the shared canvas, allowing you to easily create chat bubbles, sticky notes, and emoji and meme stickers.


# To use this plugin

## Get the Figma desktop app
At this time, plugin development and testing needs to be done using the Figma desktop app. This is because Figma needs to read your code saved as a local file. The Figma desktop app can be downloaded here: https://www.figma.com/downloads/.

If you already have the desktop app, please make sure to update to the latest version, as several features have been added specifically in order to provide a better plugin development experience.

Log in to your account and open the file editor in the Figma desktop app
You can open any existing document or create a new one.

Go to Menu > Plugins > Development > New Plugin...
This will bring up the "Create a plugin" modal to create a sample plugin. Give it a name, then choose "With UI & browser APIs" in the next screen. Save the plugin anywhere on disk.
